As completed per the curriculum of COMP 5970: Game Design & Development at Auburn University.

This side-scroller game follows a man in overalls as he hurdles over fences in a natural landscape.

It was my first real experience with animations (jumping, running etc...) and the inclusion of sound effects in unity.

The scripts were written in C# and the game was developed using Unity 2020.3
